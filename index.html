          <p class="lead">I love you soo much. Thanks for showering me with bottomless love. A few notable occasions:<br>
            <ul>
            <li>Driving all the way back to Logan if I forgot my notebook</li>
            <li>Ensuring me that “it would be okay” if I called you in tears after feeling defeated at Berkeley</li>
            <li>Bringing me around Bangkok to get the best street food</li>
            </ul>
Shelter in place makes me really miss you and dad. I’m so glad I can still drive home to drop off banana muffins and wave from 6 feet away. Can’t wait for this to be over so that I can give you a BIG hug.<br>

          <p class="lead">You are smart, you are kind, you are giving, you are loving. When my coworkers and friends ask me who my hero is, it's no question that you (and dad) are. I look back to when I was a little crybaby brat and I don't know what you had in you to still practice so much love and patience with me. Thank you, mama. </p>
          <p class="lead">I always look forward to hearing and seeing your beaming face, telling you about all the little happenings in my life, seeing your plant and flower babies bringing you joy, hearing about your upcoming meals, cleaning projects, and adventures with Dad. You've taught me so much in all the stages of my life, and while there were awkward stages or moments of ambiguity with where I was going with my life, you were always there cheering me on: from teaching me not to throw toys at adults and making me sit in the corner for time-out, spending time with me after school to help me with my chemistry homework, to helping me with my college applications, guiding how I handle difficult situations and relationships, walking me through my confusing taxes, to supporting my big decision to move to Switzerland.</p>
           <p class="lead">Thanks for giving me a great life, for choosing Dad even though you say it was the "last train," and for giving me Nade and Noohn, and still making me your favorite despite the drama that came with it.</p>
          <p class="lead">I love you so muchhhhhh. LUMMMM MUMMMMMMM. To many more years of memories to come!</p>
